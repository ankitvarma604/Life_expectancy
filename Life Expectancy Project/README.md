Predicting Life Expectancy using Machine Learning


Project Summary
Our aim is to predict the life expectancy of a person of a given country considering a number of factors like sex differences, mental illnesses, etc. The data set provides us with a number of factors which could be considered to make this prediction.
 
Project Requirements 
The project requires the data set, Python, IBM Watson Studio, IBM Cloud as well as Node Red.
 
Functional Requirements
The project is required to make the prediction of life expectancy. Moreover, it has perform data pre-processing and data analysis to make sure that accuracy could be achieved. 
 
Technical Requirements
The programming language used to make the project would be Python. The front end would be done on Noe Red which is a tool provided by IBM. Alos, IBM cloud would we used to deploy the project online and make it available for people all around the world.
 
Software Requirements
A stable internet connection is all that is needed to access the project. Users will just need to enter the URL of the website hosted on IBM Cloud to access the entire project.
 
Project Deliverables
The project will have a good user interface so that users can find it easy to interact to. Moreover, it will predict the life expectancy of the person who is living in a particular country. The user will have to enter a number of details so that the model can calculate according and predict the life expectancy of a person with those details.
