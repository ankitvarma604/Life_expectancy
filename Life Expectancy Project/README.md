Predicting Life Expectancy using Machine Learning


### Project Summary
Our aim is to predict the life expectancy of a person of a given country considering a number of factors like sex differences, mental illnesses, etc. The data set provides us with a number of factors which could be considered to make this prediction.
 
### Project Requirements 
The project requires the data set, Python, IBM Watson Studio, IBM Cloud as well as Node Red.
 
### Functional Requirements
The project is required to make the prediction of life expectancy. Moreover, it has perform data pre-processing and data analysis to make sure that accuracy could be achieved. 
 
### Technical Requirements
The programming language used to make the project would be Python. The front end would be done on Noe Red which is a tool provided by IBM. Alos, IBM cloud would we used to deploy the project online and make it available for people all around the world.
 

### Project Deliverables
The project will have a good user interface so that users can find it easy to interact to. Moreover, it will predict the life expectancy of the person who is living in a particular country. The user will have to enter a number of details so that the model can calculate according and predict the life expectancy of a person with those details.
